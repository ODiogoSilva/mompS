# mompS
Whole genome sequencing (WGS) has revolutionized the subtyping of L. pneumophila (Lp) but calling the traditional sequence based type from genomic data is hampered by presence of multiple copies of the mompS locus. We propose a novel bioinformatics solution for rectifying that limitation, ensuring the feasibility of WGS for cluster investigation.
